# parking

## Task
As input you have set of pair **{start, end}**.
Here 
- start - time of beginning car parking time
- end - time of finish car parking time

Need to find max count of parked cars

## Restrictions
- We use as time **millis** (long type)
- We assume that input data is valid (start is before end always)
- Validation could be added later
